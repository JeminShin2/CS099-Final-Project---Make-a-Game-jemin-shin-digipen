1. Shapes

Well I made all the models except background_image from what I learned in class.
(like rect(20,20,100,) )

2. Colors

I tried not to use dark colors for the background as much as much as I could.
Most of the designs were white and provided transparency so that the background_image could be seen.

3. Variables

Used to enter locations above most buttons, Current_Screen, Current_Music.

4. Conditional Statements 

Current_Screen, Current_Music etc.
Outputs GameScreen, MainScreen, Music1, Music2, and so on, depending on the current value.

5. Loops

I used Loops with a for() statement to increase with the number of Note arrays. (Note_Spawn 1 , Note_Spawn 2)

6. Functions

sketch.js - Displays each screen according to current_screen and resizes background images, windows

StartScreen.js - Print out the name, start, credit, and play method of the game

MainScreen.js - Output songs according to Current_Music.

It can play the select songs  

GameScreen - Prints the game screen.
The color of each area becomes darker when the key is pressed.

Note1_spawn,Note2_spawn.js
It can enter the X position that will appear in Note.js to fit the Note class, the rate at which Y will descend, and the time at which it will appear.




7. Classes

Note.js - It can adjust the location of the X where the Note appears, 
and the speed at which the Note comes down.


Arrays

Note1_spawn,Note2spawn used an array for each note count.
