My game is simple rhythm Game .
When the note comes down and I press the button (ASDFJKL;) in each area to the rhythm.


I created the game on Game_Screen and dropped and created notes on Note1_spawner, Note2_spawner.
If you press the start button on the start screen, it will go to the main screen, and if you press the song you want to play on the main screen, it will go to the game screen. On the game screen, notes fall to the song you choose.
Nothing appears when you run the game screen. Note1_Spawn.js will drop notes to match music on the game screen.
